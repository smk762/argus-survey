## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Scaffold from argus-pkg-template; Docker image on Ubuntu 26.04 with PDAL 2.10 / GDAL 3.13 / PROJ 9.9 from a pinned conda-forge lockfile, and datum grids (AUSGeoid2020, AUSGeoid09, GDA94→GDA2020 conformal+distortion, AGQG, GEOID18) verified by SHA256.
- `argus-survey doctor`: tool versions, PDAL/GDAL drivers and algorithms, datum grids, and the surveyor transformations (GDA2020/GDA94 → MGA + AHD, NAD83(2011) → NAVD88) resolved without ballpark fallbacks.
- One subprocess runner that records every command, and explicit coordinate-operation selection that refuses rather than falling back to a ballpark transform.
- `info` and `ingest`: CRS records (compound, ellipsoidal, user-supplied, assumed), `--t-srs` through an explicit PROJ operation with axis-order compensation, crop polygons with CRS sanity checks, streaming ingest + untwine COPC for drone-scale clouds, point-count reconciliation, LiDAR/photogrammetry detection.
- `synth`: synthetic survey scenes with analytically known answers (used by the tests and for demos).
